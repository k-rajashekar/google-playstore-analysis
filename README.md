# 📱 Google Play Store App & Review Analysis

This project analyzes app data and user reviews from the Google Play Store to identify patterns and key success factors for mobile apps. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visual insights to support better business decisions for app developers.

---

## 📌 Objective

To explore how app features (like category, size, price, sentiment, etc.) influence user ratings, installs, and satisfaction — ultimately helping developers optimize their apps for better performance.

---

## 🧩 Datasets Used

1. **Play Store Data** – Contains app details like name, category, rating, installs, type, price, etc.
2. **User Reviews Data** – Includes translated user reviews, sentiment labels, and sentiment scores.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Google Colab** – Environment for code execution
- **Pandas** – Data loading, wrangling, and manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization and exploration
- **Plotly** – Interactive charts for advanced visual insights

---

## 📊 Key Steps

- Cleaned missing values and inconsistent formats (e.g., price symbols, install counts, app sizes)
- Removed duplicates and standardized numeric fields
- Handled categorical and sentiment data
- Performed Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis (UBM)
- Created 15+ visualizations including heatmaps, pairplots, bar charts, box plots, scatter plots, and more
- Extracted actionable business insights

---

## 📈 Example Insights

- Most popular app categories tend to be free and lightweight
- Apps with high installs don’t always have high ratings
- Sentiment polarity aligns strongly with app ratings
- Paid apps aren’t guaranteed to perform better than free ones

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Through data wrangling and rich visualization, this project uncovers valuable insights from Play Store app and user review data. These findings can help developers make better data-driven product decisions and improve user engagement.

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Open the notebook file: `Google_Play_Store_EDA.ipynb`
2. Upload both dataset files:
   - `Playstore_data.csv`
   - `User_review_data.csv`
3. Run each cell in order (Shift + Enter) — the notebook is **deployment-ready** and will execute without any errors.
